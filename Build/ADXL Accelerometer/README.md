# Accelerometer Setup
For the accelerometer, I used the KUSBA that I purchased from PrintyPlease (https://www.printyplease.uk/KUSBA?search=kusba).

The KUSBA was very easy to set up. Instructions are here: https://github.com/xbst/KUSBA/blob/main/Docs/v2-Firmware.md

As I am using the VzPrinthead and the Goliath, I used the nozzle mount included in the repo [here](Nozzle_KUSBA.3mf).
