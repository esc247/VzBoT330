# VzBoT330 - Al

This repo contains all the config files, macros and stls that I printed after collecting them from various sources. Some of the parts were also designed by myself when I could not find something suitable for my for my VzBoT330. 

I started with an X5SA (just the normal 330 one). I upgraded my X5SA with the following in order, to make it the VzBoT as it stands now:

1) Klipper on X5SA board, with RPi 2B.
2) E3D Volcano hotend (0.6mm nozzle) - Mount: https://www.printables.com/model/181860-boxi-mount-v6-bmg-aio-mount
3) Mellow Fly Super 8 (Infinity) board and 2209 stepper drivers.
4) Euclid probe
5) Rock 4 SE board, upgraded from RPi 2B.
6) PEI bed sheet
7) Vz Gantry
8) Vz Z Assembly
9) Vz Printed Printhead
10) Goliath hotend
11) KUSBA Accelerometer
12) Beacon Probe (upgraded from Euclid Probe)
13) Upgraded Mellow PEI double sided sheet (Smooth and Textured)

TO DO:

14) Enclosure including Top Hat
15) CPAP

I plan on keeping this repo as up-to-date as possible with my current set up.

My config currently includes:

1) Klipper on Rock 4 SE (Radxa build of Debian Bullseye CLI only). Klipper configured using KIUAH (https://github.com/th33xitus/kiauh)
2) KAMP (https://github.com/kyleisah/Klipper-Adaptive-Meshing-Purging) 

I used KIUAH to install:
1) Klipper
2) Mainsail
3) Moonraker
4) Crowsnest
5) OctoEverywhere
